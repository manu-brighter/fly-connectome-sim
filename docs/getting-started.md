# Getting started

[Back to the project overview](../README.md)

Run commands from the repository root. The required tools are a manual
prerequisite: this repository does not contain a tool-download/bootstrap script.
The Windows setup was exercised with Python **3.12.14**, uv **0.12.15**, Zig
**0.16.0**, and Node.js **25.9.0**. Obtain uv and Node.js from their upstream
distributions; on Windows, also obtain the Zig 0.16.0 x86_64 Windows archive.
Keep these versions when reproducing that environment.

On Windows, extract uv to `.tools/uv/uv.exe` and Zig so that its executable is
`.tools/zig/zig-x86_64-windows-0.16.0/zig.exe`. Those ignored directories are
absent in a fresh checkout. Then install the pinned Python and dependencies:

```powershell
.tools/uv/uv.exe --version
.tools/zig/zig-x86_64-windows-0.16.0/zig.exe version
node --version
.tools/uv/uv.exe python install 3.12.14 --install-dir .tools/python --no-bin --no-registry --cache-dir .tools/uv-cache
.tools/uv/uv.exe sync --locked --extra test --cache-dir .tools/uv-cache --python .tools/python/cpython-3.12.14-windows-x86_64-none/python.exe
```

On Linux/macOS, install uv and Node.js on `PATH`, plus your platform's C++17
toolchain exposing `c++`. No Unix compiler version is pinned or locally verified
yet; retain the exact compiler version recorded in the native build metadata for
reproduction on that platform. The existing Unix build path uses `c++`, while
Windows selects the project-local Zig above. `FLY_CONNECTOME_SIM_CXX` can override either
with an absolute executable path.

```sh
uv --version
node --version
c++ --version
export UV_PYTHON_INSTALL_DIR="$PWD/.tools/python"
uv python install 3.12.14 --no-bin --cache-dir .tools/uv-cache
uv sync --locked --extra test --cache-dir .tools/uv-cache --python 3.12.14
```

## Download, verify, stage and prepare

The three source tables come from the
[official HHMI Janelia release](https://male-cns.janelia.org/download/).
Allow space for the 1.1 GB download plus normalized and prepared outputs. Staging
uses hard links, so source and runtime directories must share a filesystem.
Raw and runtime data stay outside Git.

On Windows, after the dependency sync above:

```powershell
node scripts/download-connectome.mjs
.venv/Scripts/python.exe -m fly_connectome_sim.data verify-sources data/malecns-v1.0
.venv/Scripts/python.exe -m fly_connectome_sim.data stage data/malecns-v1.0
.venv/Scripts/python.exe -m fly_connectome_sim.neural.connectome malecns_v1
.venv/Scripts/python.exe -m fly_connectome_sim.neural.prepare
.venv/Scripts/python.exe -m fly_connectome_sim.data verify-prepared
.venv/Scripts/python.exe -m pytest
```

On Linux/macOS, run the same sequence with `.venv/bin/python` in place of
`.venv/Scripts/python.exe`. The downloader checks the released object generation,
size and MD5; `verify-sources` checks the manifest's SHA-256 values. The importer
then requires every staged file's URL, size and SHA-256 to match the packaged
`neural/sources.lock.json` before writing outputs. Runtime verification also
checks those source files, including annotations, as well as the locked arrays
and normalized neuron metadata. `FlyEngine.from_prepared_graph()` runs this gate
before constructing the brain. A local `source.lock.json` is only an audit copy.

The default runtime directory is `data/malecns-v1.0/runtime`. To use a different
directory, set `FLY_CONNECTOME_SIM_DATA` before staging and keep it set for import,
preparation, verification and execution. Use `$env:FLY_CONNECTOME_SIM_DATA='D:/fly/runtime'`
in PowerShell or `export FLY_CONNECTOME_SIM_DATA=/path/to/runtime` in a POSIX shell. The
stage and verify-prepared commands also accept `--runtime-directory PATH`;
the environment variable remains necessary for the numerical core. Python reads
it when the neural modules are first imported.

The normal suite verifies the data and compiles/loads the native kernel. The
complete graph simulation test is opt-in because it loads and advances the graph:

```powershell
$env:FLY_CONNECTOME_SIM_FULL_TEST='1'
.venv/Scripts/python.exe -m pytest tests/test_full_graph_engine.py
```

On Linux/macOS: `FLY_CONNECTOME_SIM_FULL_TEST=1 .venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/test_full_graph_engine.py`.
Local chat notes and visual references remain outside Git.

## Experiment commands

The current CLI exposes exploratory qualification and artifact integrity
verification. Qualification is not a positive assay result or a production
frozen configuration. Its output directory must not already exist.

After preparing and verifying the graph, on Windows:

```powershell
.venv/Scripts/python.exe -m fly_connectome_sim.cli qualify --output-dir runs/qualification
.venv/Scripts/python.exe -m fly_connectome_sim.cli verify-run runs/qualification
```

On Linux/macOS, replace `.venv/Scripts/python.exe` with `.venv/bin/python`.
`verify-run` checks integrity only; native replay verification is a separate
Python API path. Native cohort production is currently exposed through Python
APIs; an `assay` CLI, 3D replay renderer and LLM event planner are still pending.

See the [assay implementation plan](superpowers/plans/2026-09-24-associative-plasticity-assay.md)
for the current scientific milestone and verification details.
